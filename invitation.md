# How could I get invitation?

## if you are a GSoC student or mentor indeed and locate in China:

- Please just create a new issue labeled with ```[Join Request]```, introduce yourself and giving the link of your (or your student's) GSoC project page, e.g 
```
I am a student working on XXX project, ...

My project is [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6008675886956544]
```
It will be approved quickly.

- If you don't want to publicize the project which you are working on, that's also acceptable. Create a new issue labeled with ```[Join Request]```, provide names and email addresses of *two or more* current GSoC-CN members who could vouch for proving you are a GSoC student/mentor. 

- You can send an email to our mail list (still working in progress), IRC channel ([#gsoccn](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23gsoccn&hostname=chat.freenode.net&port=6697&ssl=1) on freenode), [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/B30CMA1YxJ0g0yo3GLj8uA) and say hello to us :). And we of course welcome you!

## if you haven't been selected as GSoC student but want to participate,

- Welcome you checking our GSoC-Resources repo (still working in progress) and ask help in mail list, IRC, or Telegram. Everyone in GSoC-CN would love to help you finishing your GSoC intern!

After all, Happy Hacking! :)
