====================================================
1. Motivation and Description
====================================================
Virtual machines use grant table hypercalls to setup a share page for
inter-VMs communications. These hypercalls are used by all PV
protocols today. However, very simple guests, such as baremetal
applications, might not have the infrastructure to handle the grant table.
This project is about setting up several shared memory areas for inter-VMs
communications directly from the VM config file.
So that the guest kernel doesn't have to have grant table support (in the
embedded space, this is not unusual) to be able to communicate with
other guests.

====================================================
2. Implementation Plan:
====================================================

======================================
2.1 Introduce a new VM config option in xl:
======================================

2.1.1 Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shared areas should be shareable among several (>=2) VMs, so every shared
physical memory area is assigned to a set of VMs. Therefore, a “token” or
“identifier” should be used here to uniquely identify a backing memory area.
A string no longer than 128 bytes is used here to serve the purpose.

The backing area would be taken from one domain, which we will mark
as the "master domain", and this domain should be created prior to any
other "slave domain"s. Again, we have to use some kind of tag to tell who
is the "master domain".

And the ability to specify the permissions and cacheability (and shareability
for ARM guest's) of the pages to be shared should also be given to the user.

2.2.2 Syntax and Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following example illustrates the syntax of the proposed config entry
(suppose that we're on x86):

In xl config file of vm1:
  static_shm = [ 'id=ID1, begin=0x100000, end=0x200000, role=master,    \
                  cache_policy=x86_normal, prot=rw',                    \
                 'id=ID2, begin=0x300000, end=0x400000, role=master' ]

In xl config file of vm2:
  static_shm = [ 'id=ID1, offset = 0, begin=0x500000, end=0x600000,     \
                  role=slave, prot=rw' ]

In xl config file of vm3:
  static_shm = [ 'id=ID2, offset = 0x10000, begin=0x690000,             \
                  end=0x800000, role=slave' ]

where:
  @id              The identifier of the backing memory area.
                   Can be any string that matches the regexp "[_a-zA-Z0-9]+"
                   and no longer than 128 characters

  @offset          Can only appear when @role = slave. The sharing will
                   start from the beginning of backing memory area plus
                   this offset. If not set, it defaults to zero.
                   Can be decimals or hexadecimals of the form "0x20000",
                   and should be the multiple of the hypervisor page
                   granularity (currently 4K on both ARM and x86).

  @begin/end       The boundaries of the shared memory area. The format
                   requirements are the same with @offset. This should also
                   be the multiple of the hypervisor page granularity (currently
                   4K on both ARM and x86).

  @role            Can only be 'master' or 'slave', it defaults to 'slave'.

  @prot            When @role = master, this means the largest set of
                   stage-2 permission flags that can be granted to the
                   slave domains.
                   When @role = slave, this means the stage-2 permission
                   flags of the shared memory area.
                   Currently only 'rw' is supported. If not set. it
                   defaults to 'rw'.

  @cache_policy    Can only appear when @role = master.
                   The stage-2 cacheability/shareability attributes of the
                   shared memory area. Currently, only two policies are
                   supported:
                     * ARM_normal: Only applicable to ARM guests. This
                                   would mean Inner and Outer Write-Back
                                   Cacheable, and Inner Shareable.
                     * x86_normal: Only applicable to x86 HVM guests. This
                                   would mean Write-Back Cacheable.
                   If not set, it defaults to the *_normal policy for the
                   current platform.

Note:
  The sizes of the areas specified by @begin and @end in the slave
  domain's config file should be smaller than or equal to the corresponding
  sizes specified in its master's domain. And @offset should always be within
  the backing memory region. A master can offer several overlapping regions as
  the backing memory region for several different sshm ID's, but the slaves
  can't map two different backing memory regions into an overlapping memory
  space. And each shared memory region ID can appear at most once in one
  domain's xl config file.
  The "master" role in vm1 for both ID1 and ID2 indicates that vm1 should be
  created prior to both vm2 and vm3, for they both rely on the pages backed by
  vm1. If one tries to create vm2 or vm3 prior to vm1, she will get an error.

In the example above. A memory area ID1 will be shared between vm1 and vm2.
This area will be taken from vm1 and added to vm2's stage-2 page table.
The parameter "prot=rw" means that this memory area is offered with read-write
permission. vm1 can access this area using 0x100000~0x200000, and vm2 using
0x500000~0x600000. The stage-2 cache policy of this backing memory area is
x86_normal.

Likewise, a memory area ID2 will be shared between vm1 and vm3 with read-write
permissions. vm1 is the master and vm2 the slave. Note the @offset = 0x10000
in vm2' config. The actual sharing relationship would be:
   (vm1 : 0x310000~0x400000) <=====> (vm2 : 0x690000~0x800000)
The stage-2 cache policy of this backing memory area is x86_normal.

======================================
2.2 Store the mem-sharing information in xenstore
======================================
For we don't have some persistent storage for xl to store the information
of the shared memory areas, we have to find some way to keep it between xl
launches. And xenstore is a good place to do this. The information for one
shared area should include the ID, master's domid, address range,
memory attributes and information of the slaves etc. Besides, since a master
domain can't be totally destroyed if the backing pages are still in use (whether
by itself or by the slaves), we need to refcount the sshm entry and only
cleanup the master infomation (and thus the whole sshm path) when the refcount
reaches 0.
A current plan is to place the information under /local/shared_mem/ID.
Still take the above config files as an example:

If we instantiate vm1, vm2 and vm3, one after another, “xenstore ls -f” should
output something like this:

After VM1 was instantiated, the output of “xenstore ls -f
will be something like this:

    /local/shared_mem/ID1/master = domid_of_vm1
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/begin = "0x100000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/end = "0x200000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/prot = "rw"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/cache_policy = "x86_normal"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/slaves = ""
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/users = "1"

    /local/shared_mem/ID2/master = domid_of_vm1
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/begin = "0x300000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/end = "0x400000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/permissions = "rw"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/cache_policy = "x86_normal"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/slaves = ""
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/users = "1"

After VM2 was instantiated, the following new lines will appear:

    /local/shared_mem/ID1/users = "2"

    /local/shared_mem/ID1/slaves/domid_of_vm2/begin = "0x500000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/slaves/domid_of_vm2/end = "0x600000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/slaves/domid_of_vm2/offset = "0x0"
    /local/shared_mem/ID1/slaves/domid_of_vm2/permissions = "rw"

After VM2 was instantiated, the following new lines will appear:

    /local/shared_mem/ID2/users = "2"

    /local/shared_mem/ID2/slaves/domid_of_vm3/begin = "0x690000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/slaves/domid_of_vm3/end = "0x800000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/slaves/domid_of_vm3/offset = "0x10000"
    /local/shared_mem/ID2/slaves/domid_of_vm3/permissions = "rw"


When we encounter an static_shm entry with id = IDx during "xl create":

  + If there's NO corresponding entry in xenstore:
    + If @role=master, create the corresponding entries for IDx in xenstore
    + If @role=slave, say error.

  + If the corresponding entry exists in xenstore:
    + If @role=master, say error
    + If @role=slave, map the pages to the newly created domain, and add the
      neccesasry informations under /local/shared_mem/IDx/slaves.

======================================
2.3 mapping and unmapping the memory areas
======================================
Handle the newly added config option in tools/{xl, libxl} and utilize
toos/libxc to do the actual memory mapping. Specifically, we will use
xc_domain_add_to_physmap_batch with XENMAPSPACE_gmfn_foreign to
do the actual mapping during domain creation and xc_domain_remove_from_physmap
to do the unmapping during domain destruction.

======================================
2.4 error handling
======================================
Add code to handle various errors: Invalid address, invalid permissions, wrong
order of vm creation, wrong length of memory area, unsupported vms etc.

====================================================
3. Expected Outcomes/Goals:
====================================================
A new VM config option in xl will be introduced, allowing users to setup
several shared memory areas for inter-VMs communications.
This should work on both x86 and ARM.

====================================================
3. Future Directions:
====================================================
Implement the missing @prot flags and @cache_policy options.

Allow users to optionally share mfn-contiguous pages.

Set up a notification channel between domains who are communicating through
shared memory regions, this allows one vm to signal her friends when data is
available in the shared memory or when the data in the shared memory is
consumed. The channel could be built upon PPI or SGI.
